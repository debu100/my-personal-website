    <!--<div> is an element by which we group contents together.These don't have
 any height by default and therefore don't appear on the webpage by their own.
We need to apply css styles to the div elements,by which they can apper on the page
It stands for content division element and allows us to split up or divide the content into separate containers
or boxes to affect the layout of each box separately.The div will have a height if it has some content in it.
Now as it has h1 and p within it, it will have a height which is 76px which is just enough to keep the h1 and p 
to fit it/contain it.
viewport is just the screen that you are viewing the website on-laptop/mobile etc...
padding and border increases the size of the element on which they are used, but margin does not.
giving padding actually does not change the height and width of the element but it eventually makes the entire element bigger in size
When we apply border to div or some element then we can see that the border does not affect the size of the part that has
the actual element but it makes the whole element even larger.
When we have padding it only pads the content but not things like the background image or the background color.
margin does not affect the height or the width of the element,margin is space b/w 2 and more element.

Block elements----takes up the whole width of the screen and blokcs out any other elements from sitting next to it
on the left or the right.
ex---p,h1 to h6, div, ol,ul,li, form element.
<span> allows to highlight a section of my text, just select one part of the text in order to style it differently.
<span> like div don't do much themselves unless they are used in conjuction with the CSS.
<span> is an inline element. An inline elememt only takes as much space as it needs to in the height and in it's width
common inline elements--- spans, images and anchor tags.

THERE IS ONE PROBLEM WITH INLINE ELEMENTS
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF THE ELEMENTS.BUT FOR BLOCK ELEMENTS WE CAN APPLY HEIGHT AND WIDTH 
PROPERTIES AND THEY WORK SMOOTHLY.AND THEY ALSO DON'T ALLOW OTHER ELEMENTS SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

NOW, WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THE DISPLAY PROPERTY OF ANY GIVEN ELEMENT.WE CAN CHANGE A <P> TO AN INLINE ONE AND BY DOING 
THIS WE LOSE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT'S HEIGHT AND WIDTH.AND WE CHANGE A <SPAN>TO A BLOCK ONE AND BY DOING THIS
WE GAIN THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF THE BLCOK ELEMENT

SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I WANTED ELEMENTS THAT OCUUPY THE SAME LINE AND CA HAVE THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH PREOPERTIES

WE HAVE DISPLAY: INLINE-BLOCK

INSTEAD OF CHANGING A <P> TO INLINE CHANGE IT TO INLINE-BLOCK AND BY DOING THIS THE<P> WILL BEHAVE AS AN INLINE
ELEMENT THAT IS IT WILL ALLOW OTHER ELEMENTS TO SIT NEXT TO IT AND WE WILL ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEIGHT AND
WIDTH PROPERTIES.(VERY HELPFUL).

BY DEFAULT <IMG> ARE INLINE-BLOCK ELEMENTS.(KIND OF) CHECK THE LINK IN RESOURCE.

WE WILL TREAT <IMG> AS INLINE-BLOCK ELEMENTS.AS WE CAN CHANGE THEIR HEIGHT AND WIDTH AND THEY ALSO GET DIAPLAYED 
NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE SAME LINE.

DISPLAY:NONE COMPLETELY REMOVES THE ELEMENT FROM THE PAGE AS IF IT NEVER EXISTED.IT'S ORIGINAL POSITION WILL NOT BE
RESTORED IN ANY WAY, IT'S SAME AS DELETING THE ELEMNET FROM THE HTML FILE.

VISIBILTY:HIDDEN  HERE THE ELEMENT WILL BE REMOVED BUT THE ACTUAL POSITION WILL BE STORED AND A SPACE WILL BE THERE
ON THE PAGE.ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS STILL FLOW AROUND IT AS IF THAT ELEMNT IS STILL PRESENT ON THE PAGE.
WITH PADDING WE CAN INCREASE THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT OF AN ELEMENT(LIKE DIV)
BORDER DOES THE SAME.-->
